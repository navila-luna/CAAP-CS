 The source I used to help me find a command to find the specific commit is through https://www.gun.io/blog/git-search-log
 What I did for Task 8 is I typed git diff READMe.txt to tell what where the changes in the file relative to the latest commit
 I used this as a resource for task 8

 What I did is I used rm to remove the file. This is a command that we used earlier on and it's also provided on the cheat sheet Jose gave us
