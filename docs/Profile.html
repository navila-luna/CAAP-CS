    <h1> Why I created Matrix</h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Nicole Avila and I'm a rising Freshman at UChicago.
        From a young age, music has been a source of inspiration and stress relief. From then on, I worked hard on developing my music as well as other artist's dreams. The sole purpose of DTRIX is to spread the music of artists to the world and make indie music better known.
